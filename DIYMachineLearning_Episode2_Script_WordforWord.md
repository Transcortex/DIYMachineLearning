## Episode 2: Creating Your Developer Environment in WSL

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! Today, we’ll set up a developer environment in WSL, keeping everything organized for our machine learning projects. Having a good structure for our files and tools is essential as we work with data and models."

---

### 00:30 - 02:30 | Creating Folders for Development
- **Script:** "Let’s start by creating folders to keep our projects tidy. Open Ubuntu, and type `mkdir Projects` to create a Projects folder. Then type `cd Projects` to enter the folder. Inside this Projects folder, we can add subfolders for each new project."

---

### 02:30 - 04:30 | Installing Git
- **Script:** "Next, let’s install Git, a tool to manage and track our code. In the terminal, type `sudo apt install git` to install it. After installation, check it by typing `git --version`. Git helps keep versions of our code, making it easy to track changes."

---

### 04:30 - 08:00 | Basic Command Line Navigation
- **Script:** "Here are some basic commands to navigate. `ls` lists the files and folders. Use `cd foldername` to move into a folder, and `cd ..` to go back up. These commands make it easier to organize and locate files as we work on different projects."

---

### 08:00 - 10:00 | Overview of Text Editors (Nano and Vim)
- **Script:** "In Linux, we use text editors for writing code. Nano is beginner-friendly. Type `nano test.txt` to create and edit a new file, then press `Ctrl + X` to exit, `Y` to save, and Enter to confirm. Vim is another option, but it has a steeper learning curve. We’ll use Nano for simplicity."

### Closing
- **Script:** "That’s it for Episode 2! You now have a structured environment in WSL, ready to start working on machine learning projects. In the next episode, we’ll install TensorFlow. Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and join us for more DIYMachineLearning!"
