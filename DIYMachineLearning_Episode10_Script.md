## Episode 10: Evaluating Your Image Classifier Model

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! Now that we’ve built and trained our first image classifier, it’s time to evaluate its performance. Evaluating a model helps us understand how well it’s learned to classify images and identify any areas for improvement. Today, we’ll cover accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, as well as review a confusion matrix for better insights."
- **Screen Capture:** Intro screen with episode title and a visual representation of performance metrics.
- **Effort:** Set the stage for understanding model evaluation and why these metrics are critical to improving our model.

---

### 00:30 - 03:00 | Loading the Model and Test Data
- **Script:** "To evaluate the model, we need both the trained model and some test data. Let’s load our model and use a separate dataset that the model hasn’t seen during training to get a more realistic evaluation."
- **Code:**
  ```python
  from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
  from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

  # Load the trained model
  model = load_model('path_to_your_trained_model.h5')

  # Prepare the test data
  test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1.0/255)
  test_data = test_datagen.flow_from_directory('dataset/test', target_size=(128, 128), batch_size=32, class_mode='binary')
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Show loading the model and preparing the test dataset, highlighting the path and settings.
- **Effort:** Explain why using unseen test data is essential for an unbiased evaluation.

### 03:00 - 05:30 | Evaluating Model Accuracy
- **Script:** "Accuracy is the simplest evaluation metric, representing the percentage of correct predictions. We’ll use our model’s `evaluate` function to get the accuracy and loss values on the test set."
- **Code:**
  ```python
  test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(test_data)
  print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Show the evaluation process and display the accuracy result.
- **Effort:** Emphasize that accuracy is a good starting point but may not fully represent model performance, especially in imbalanced datasets.

---

### 05:30 - 07:30 | Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
- **Script:** "In addition to accuracy, precision and recall provide deeper insights. Precision is the percentage of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions the model made. Recall is the percentage of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. The F1 score combines precision and recall into a single metric. Let’s calculate these metrics using Scikit-learn."
- **Code:**
  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

  # Assume y_true and y_pred are lists of true labels and model predictions
  y_true = test_data.classes  # True labels
  y_pred = (model.predict(test_data) > 0.5).astype("int32").flatten()  # Model predictions

  precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
  recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
  f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred)

  print(f"Precision: {precision:.2f}, Recall: {recall:.2f}, F1 Score: {f1:.2f}")
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Show the calculation and display results for precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Effort:** Explain the significance of each metric and how F1 score balances precision and recall, especially for imbalanced datasets.

### 07:30 - 09:00 | Creating a Confusion Matrix
- **Script:** "A confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. It provides a detailed view of how well the model performs across different classes. Let’s generate a confusion matrix with Scikit-learn."
- **Code:**
  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
  import seaborn as sns
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
  sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=['Cat', 'Dog'], yticklabels=['Cat', 'Dog'])
  plt.xlabel('Predicted')
  plt.ylabel('Actual')
  plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
  plt.show()
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Display the confusion matrix as a heatmap with clear labels and explanations.
- **Effort:** Explain each part of the matrix and why it’s helpful to understand the types of errors the model is making.

---

### 09:00 - 10:00 | Reviewing Evaluation Results
- **Script:** "By reviewing accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the confusion matrix, we get a complete picture of the model’s performance. If precision or recall is low, or if the confusion matrix shows many false positives or negatives, these areas signal where we might improve. For example, adding more diverse data or adjusting model parameters could help."
- **Screen Capture:** Show a summary of all metrics and discuss potential areas for improvement based on the results.
- **Effort:** Encourage viewers to explore different techniques for improvement based on evaluation insights.

---

### Closing
- **Script:** "That’s it for evaluating our image classifier! We now have a thorough understanding of how well it performs and areas where it can improve. In the next episode, we’ll look at hyperparameter tuning to further optimize our model. Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and hit the bell icon to keep learning with DIYMachineLearning!"
- **Screen Capture:** Outro screen with the series name, episode number, and a teaser for the next episode on hyperparameter tuning.
- **Effort:** Motivate viewers to try adjusting their model based on the evaluation insights to see how it affects performance.
