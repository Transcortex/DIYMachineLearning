## Episode 11: Hyperparameter Tuning for Improved Model Performance

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! Today, we’re diving into hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameters are settings we adjust before training to improve our model’s performance. Let’s learn which ones to tune and why it matters."

---

### 00:30 - 03:00 | Key Hyperparameters to Tune
- **Script:** "Some important hyperparameters to tune are the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. The learning rate controls how fast the model learns, batch size decides how many samples are processed at once, and epochs are how many times the model sees the data."

---

### 03:00 - 05:30 | Using Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Script:** "Grid search tests different combinations of hyperparameters to find the best ones. We can automate this process using `GridSearchCV` from Scikit-learn. It saves time and finds the most effective settings."

---

### 05:30 - 07:30 | Interpreting Grid Search Results
- **Script:** "Once grid search completes, it shows the best combination of hyperparameters and the accuracy. We can compare these results to our original settings and see if there’s an improvement."

---

### 07:30 - 09:00 | Visualizing Model Performance with Different Hyperparameters
- **Script:** "Let’s plot the results to see which hyperparameter combinations worked best. Visualization helps us understand which settings affect the model’s accuracy."

---

### 09:00 - 10:00 | Final Thoughts on Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Script:** "Hyperparameter tuning can greatly improve model performance, but it can be time-consuming. The key is finding the right balance between tuning important hyperparameters and keeping the process manageable."
