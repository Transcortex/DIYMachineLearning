## Episode 9: Building a Simple Image Classifier Model in TensorFlow

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! Today, we’ll build our first image classifier model using TensorFlow. This is a big step toward training a model that can recognize and categorize images based on what it’s learned."

---

### 00:30 - 03:30 | Importing Libraries and Loading Data
- **Script:** "First, let’s import TensorFlow and other libraries. We’ll also load our preprocessed image data using `ImageDataGenerator`. This will help us load and process images in batches, which is more efficient for training."

---

### 03:30 - 06:30 | Defining the Model Architecture
- **Script:** "Next, we’ll define our model using a Convolutional Neural Network, or CNN. CNNs are perfect for image recognition. Our model will have convolutional layers to find features, pooling layers to reduce size, and dense layers for prediction."

---

### 06:30 - 08:30 | Compiling the Model
- **Script:** "With the model ready, let’s compile it. We’ll use the Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy for our binary classification task, and accuracy as our metric."

---

### 08:30 - 09:30 | Training the Model
- **Script:** "Now, we’ll train the model for 10 epochs, meaning the model will go through the dataset 10 times. Each epoch helps the model learn and improve its accuracy."

---

### 09:30 - 10:00 | Reviewing Training Results
- **Script:** "Let’s check our results. Look at accuracy and loss values to see how well the model learned. In future episodes, we’ll discuss ways to improve performance further."

---

### Closing
- **Script:** "That’s our first image classifier! We’ve built, trained, and reviewed it. Next, we’ll explore more ways to evaluate and improve it. Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and join us for more DIYMachineLearning!"
