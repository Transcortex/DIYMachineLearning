## Episode 12: Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning with Random Search

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! In the last episode, we used grid search for hyperparameter tuning. Today, we’ll explore random search, a faster way to find good hyperparameters by sampling combinations randomly."

---

### 00:30 - 03:00 | Differences Between Grid Search and Random Search
- **Script:** "With grid search, we test all combinations, which can be slow. Random search samples combinations, making it quicker. This is useful when we have many hyperparameters to test."

---

### 03:00 - 06:00 | Setting Up Random Search in Scikit-Learn
- **Script:** "Let’s use `RandomizedSearchCV` from Scikit-Learn to set up random search. We’ll specify ranges for each hyperparameter and let random search find effective combinations within these ranges."

---

### 06:00 - 08:00 | Reviewing Random Search Results
- **Script:** "Once random search finishes, we can check the best hyperparameters and accuracy. Random search often finds similar results as grid search but with less time and effort."

---

### 08:00 - 09:00 | Visualizing Random Search Results
- **Script:** "Let’s plot the results to see which random combinations worked best. This visualization helps us see which settings improved accuracy."

---

### 09:00 - 10:00 | Choosing Between Grid and Random Search
- **Script:** "Choosing between grid and random search depends on the problem. Grid search is thorough, while random search is faster for larger problems. Both methods have their advantages, so pick based on your project’s needs."

---

### Closing
- **Script:** "That wraps up random search for hyperparameter tuning! Now we know how to find good settings quickly. In the next episode, we’ll explore advanced optimization methods. Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and join us for more DIYMachineLearning!"
