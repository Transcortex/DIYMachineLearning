## Episode 6: Introduction to Supervised Learning

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! Today, we’re exploring supervised learning. This type of machine learning uses labeled data, which means data with answers, to teach a model. We’ll learn what supervised learning is and why it’s so useful."

---

### 00:30 - 03:00 | What is Supervised Learning?
- **Script:** "In supervised learning, we use labeled data to teach the model. For example, to recognize cats and dogs, we provide labeled images of each. The model learns from these examples and can classify new images in the future."

---

### 03:00 - 06:00 | Features and Labels
- **Script:** "Data has features and labels. Features are characteristics, like color or shape, that help describe the item. The label is the answer or category. In our example, the label could be ‘cat’ or ‘dog’. Understanding features and labels is important for preparing datasets."

### 06:00 - 08:30 | Types of Supervised Learning Tasks
- **Script:** "Supervised learning has two main types: classification and regression. Classification separates items into categories, like cats or dogs. Regression predicts continuous values, like house prices. Both types help us solve different problems."

### 08:30 - 10:00 | Real-World Examples of Supervised Learning
- **Script:** "Supervised learning is everywhere. Spam filters, photo tagging, and recommendation systems all use supervised learning to make smart predictions and help us daily."

### Closing
- **Script:** "That’s supervised learning! Now we know what it is, how it works, and where it’s used. In the next episode, we’ll start building a supervised learning model. Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and join us on DIYMachineLearning!"
