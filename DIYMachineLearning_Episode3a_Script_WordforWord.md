## Episode 3a: Installing Jupyter Notebook Locally in WSL with a Virtual Environment

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! Today, we’ll install Jupyter Notebook, a tool that lets us write code, add notes, and visualize data, all in one place. We’ll install it in our WSL environment within a virtual environment to keep everything organized."

---

### 00:30 - 02:30 | Activating the Virtual Environment in WSL
- **Script:** "To start, activate the virtual environment we created in WSL. Type `source tf_env/bin/activate`. Using virtual environments keeps everything separated and organized for each project."

---

### 02:30 - 04:00 | Installing Jupyter Notebook in WSL
- **Script:** "With the virtual environment active, type `pip install jupyter` to install Jupyter Notebook. This way, Jupyter will be available only within this environment, keeping your system tidy."

---

### 04:00 - 06:30 | Launching Jupyter Notebook in WSL and Accessing it in the Browser
- **Script:** "Let’s start Jupyter by typing `jupyter notebook` in WSL. This will open a link in the terminal. Copy and paste it into your browser to open the Jupyter Notebook interface."

---

### 06:30 - 08:00 | Exploring the Jupyter Notebook Interface and Key Concepts
- **Script:** "In Jupyter, each notebook is made up of cells. You can use Code cells to run Python code and Markdown cells to add text explanations. Let’s try creating a code cell, typing `print("Hello, Jupyter!")`, and pressing Shift + Enter to run it."

---

### 08:00 - 09:30 | Saving and Closing a Notebook
- **Script:** "To save your work, go to ‘File’ > ‘Save and Checkpoint’. To close Jupyter, go back to the WSL terminal and press `Ctrl + C`. This stops the server. You can always restart it by reactivating the virtual environment and typing `jupyter notebook`."

---

### Closing
- **Script:** "And that’s it! Jupyter Notebook is now set up in WSL. Jupyter is a great tool for writing and testing code, adding notes, and visualizing data. In the next episode, we’ll continue our setup with more machine learning tools. Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and hit the bell to keep up with DIYMachineLearning!"
