## Episode 11: Hyperparameter Tuning for Improved Model Performance

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! In this episode, we’re diving into hyperparameter tuning, which is the process of optimizing model settings to improve performance. Unlike regular parameters, which are learned by the model during training, hyperparameters are manually set before training begins. Tuning these can have a big impact on our model’s results!"
- **Screen Capture:** Intro screen with episode title and an example of parameters vs. hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size).
- **Effort:** Highlight the difference between parameters and hyperparameters and explain why tuning is essential for maximizing model performance.

---

### 00:30 - 03:00 | Key Hyperparameters to Tune
- **Script:** "Some of the most important hyperparameters to adjust include learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs. The learning rate determines how fast the model learns, the batch size controls how many samples are processed at once, and epochs decide how many times the model sees the data during training. Let’s start by focusing on tuning the learning rate."
- **Screen Capture:** Show each hyperparameter and provide a brief description alongside visuals for better understanding.
- **Effort:** Explain each hyperparameter in simple terms, making it clear how each one impacts the model’s learning process.

### 03:00 - 05:30 | Using Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Script:** "One popular approach to tuning hyperparameters is grid search, where we try multiple combinations to see which one works best. Let’s use Scikit-learn’s GridSearchCV to automate this process and test different learning rates and batch sizes."
- **Code:**
  ```python
  from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
  from tensorflow.keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasClassifier

  # Define a function to create the model
  def create_model(learning_rate=0.001):
      model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
          tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 3)),
          tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
          tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
          tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
          tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
      ])
      model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate),
                    loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
      return model

  model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_model, epochs=5, batch_size=32, verbose=0)
  param_grid = {'batch_size': [16, 32, 64], 'learning_rate': [0.001, 0.0001, 0.01]}
  grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, cv=3)
  grid_result = grid.fit(train_data, validation_data=validation_data)
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Show the code in a Jupyter notebook or IDE, explaining each step, especially the parameter grid.
- **Effort:** Emphasize how grid search tests different combinations of hyperparameters and how automation makes it easier to find optimal settings.

### 05:30 - 07:30 | Interpreting Grid Search Results
- **Script:** "Once grid search is complete, we can view the best hyperparameter combination and the corresponding accuracy. Let’s print out the best parameters and compare them to see how they improve our model."
- **Code:**
  ```python
  print(f"Best Hyperparameters: {grid_result.best_params_}")
  print(f"Best Accuracy: {grid_result.best_score_ * 100:.2f}%")
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Display the results and highlight the best hyperparameters with comments on the accuracy achieved.
- **Effort:** Explain why certain hyperparameters may yield better results, based on observed accuracy, to deepen understanding.

---

### 07:30 - 09:00 | Visualizing Model Performance with Different Hyperparameters
- **Script:** "Let’s visualize how different combinations of hyperparameters affected model accuracy. This will give us insights into which settings led to better performance and help us make more informed decisions for future tuning."
- **Code:**
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  # Extract grid search results
  scores = [x.mean_test_score for x in grid_result.cv_results_]
  param_combinations = [str(x) for x in grid_result.cv_results_['params']]

  plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
  plt.plot(param_combinations, scores, 'o-')
  plt.xticks(rotation=90)
  plt.xlabel("Hyperparameter Combinations")
  plt.ylabel("Accuracy")
  plt.title("Model Performance with Different Hyperparameters")
  plt.show()
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Show the plot and explain the accuracy trend across different hyperparameter combinations.
- **Effort:** Emphasize that visualizing performance aids in understanding which hyperparameters have the greatest impact.

### 09:00 - 10:00 | Final Thoughts on Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Script:** "Hyperparameter tuning can make a big difference in model performance, but it can be time-consuming. The key is to find a balance between tuning the right hyperparameters and keeping the process manageable. For our next episode, we’ll look into another powerful tuning method called Random Search."
- **Screen Capture:** Display a summary of the best hyperparameters and briefly mention next steps.
- **Effort:** Conclude by encouraging viewers to experiment with other hyperparameters or methods and see the impact on their models.
