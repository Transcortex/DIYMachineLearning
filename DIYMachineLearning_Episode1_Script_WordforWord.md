## Episode 1: Setting Up Windows 11 with WSL for Machine Learning

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome to DIYMachineLearning! In this series, we’ll set up a machine learning environment from scratch, right on your computer. Today, we’ll start by setting up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows 11. WSL allows us to use Linux tools and programs directly in Windows, perfect for machine learning."

---

### 00:30 - 01:30 | Why WSL?
- **Script:** "You may wonder, why use WSL? With WSL, you get the power of Linux without leaving Windows. This means access to Python, TensorFlow, and many other tools. It’s easier and saves time because you don’t need a separate Linux machine."

---

### 01:30 - 03:30 | Enabling WSL
- **Script:** "To enable WSL, first open the Start Menu and type ‘Turn Windows features on or off.’ Click it. Find and check the box for **Windows Subsystem for Linux**. Then click OK and restart your computer when asked."

---

### 03:30 - 05:30 | Installing Ubuntu
- **Script:** "After restarting, open the Microsoft Store. Search for ‘Ubuntu’ and download it. This gives us a Linux environment. When it’s ready, open Ubuntu and set up a username and password for Linux access."

---

### 05:30 - 07:30 | Updating and Upgrading Linux
- **Script:** "Now, let’s update Linux. In Ubuntu, type `sudo apt update` and press Enter. Then type `sudo apt upgrade`. This checks and installs updates to keep things current."

---

### 07:30 - 09:30 | Installing Essential Developer Tools
- **Script:** "Next, we’ll add some developer tools. Type `sudo apt install build-essential` for compilers, and `sudo apt install python3-pip` for Python packages. This is important for coding and installing packages."

---

### 09:30 - 10:00 | Testing the Setup
- **Script:** "Finally, let’s test the setup. Type `python3 --version` and `pip3 --version`. If you see version numbers, everything is working."

---

### Closing
- **Script:** "And that’s it for Episode 1! We have Linux running in Windows, and we’re ready for machine learning. In the next episode, we’ll install TensorFlow. Make sure to like, subscribe, and join us next time!"
