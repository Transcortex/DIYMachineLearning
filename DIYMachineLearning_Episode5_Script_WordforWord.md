## Episode 5: Designing Basic ML Pipelines

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! Today, we’ll design a basic ML pipeline. A pipeline is a sequence of steps, from data preparation to model training, making our work organized and efficient. We’ll walk through each step today."

---

### 00:30 - 03:30 | Understanding ML Pipeline Stages
- **Script:** "Our pipeline has four stages: data collection, data processing, model training, and evaluation. In data collection, we gather raw data, like CSV files. Processing cleans and prepares the data. Training teaches the model to recognize patterns, and evaluation tests its accuracy."

---

### 03:30 - 07:30 | Creating a Basic Pipeline Code Structure
- **Script:** "Let’s create simple functions for each pipeline step. We’ll start with `load_data`, which loads a CSV file, then `process_data` to clean the data. Finally, `train_model` will be a placeholder for training, and `evaluate_model` will be a placeholder for testing."

---

### 07:30 - 09:30 | Executing the Pipeline
- **Script:** "Now, let’s run each step in sequence: load data, process data, train the model, and evaluate it. This sequence keeps our code organized and repeatable."

### Closing
- **Script:** "And that’s it for our basic pipeline! This framework will guide data through each step and make it ready for modeling. In the next episode, we’ll start building our first machine learning model. Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and join us for more DIYMachineLearning!"
