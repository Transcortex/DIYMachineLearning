### 04:30 - 06:30 | Advantages of Running ML Tools Locally
- **Script:** "So why run machine learning tools locally? For one, it gives you full control over the process, from setting up environments to customizing models. Running ML locally is also cost-effective, as you can avoid paying for cloud services. And, with tools like Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), running complex ML models on a personal computer has become easier than ever. It’s a great way to experiment, learn, and even work on real projects, all from your own machine."
- **Screen Capture:** Show visuals comparing local setups to cloud services, highlighting the benefits of cost savings, control, and customization.
- **Effort:** Clearly outline the benefits of local ML setups, especially for those who want to learn without investing in cloud infrastructure right away.
