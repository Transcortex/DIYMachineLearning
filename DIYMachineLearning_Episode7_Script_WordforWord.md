## Episode 7: Building Your First Dataset for Image Classification

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! Today, we’ll create our first dataset for image classification. A well-organized dataset is key to training accurate models. By the end of this episode, you’ll know how to gather, label, and organize images for a classification task."

---

### 00:30 - 03:00 | Finding or Collecting Images
- **Script:** "To build a dataset, start by collecting images. You can download open datasets or gather images yourself. For this demo, let’s create a dataset for classifying cats and dogs."

---

### 03:00 - 06:00 | Organizing Images into Folders
- **Script:** "Once you have images, organize them by category. Create a main folder called ‘dataset’ with subfolders for each class, like ‘cats’ and ‘dogs’. Place each image in its correct folder. This structure helps the model distinguish between classes during training."

---

### 06:00 - 08:30 | Labeling Images with Tools (LabelImg)
- **Script:** "If your images need labeling, use tools like LabelImg to assign labels. This tool allows you to draw boxes around objects and label them. It’s free and easy to use."

---

### 08:30 - 10:00 | Saving and Verifying the Dataset
- **Script:** "After organizing and labeling, double-check your work. Ensure each label and file structure is correct. Errors in labeling can lead to poor model performance, so this step is important."

### Closing
- **Script:** "And that’s it for building your first dataset! Now we have a well-organized collection of images, ready for training. In the next episode, we’ll preprocess these images to prepare them for our model. Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and join us for more DIYMachineLearning!"
