## Episode 12: Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning with Random Search

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! In our last episode, we covered hyperparameter tuning with grid search. Today, we’re exploring Random Search, another tuning method that’s often faster and more efficient for high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces. Random Search randomly samples combinations, which can sometimes yield great results with less computational effort."
- **Screen Capture:** Intro screen with episode title and a brief comparison graphic between grid search and random search.
- **Effort:** Highlight the benefit of random search as a faster alternative to grid search, especially in larger hyperparameter spaces.

---

### 00:30 - 03:00 | Differences Between Grid Search and Random Search
- **Script:** "With grid search, we exhaustively test all combinations, which can be computationally expensive. In contrast, Random Search samples random combinations within the specified ranges, making it faster while still offering a good chance of finding effective hyperparameters. Random Search can be particularly useful when we suspect that only a few hyperparameters significantly impact performance."
- **Screen Capture:** Diagram comparing grid search to random search, highlighting efficiency and sampling strategy.
- **Effort:** Simplify the comparison and explain why random search is often preferred in practical settings with many hyperparameters.

### 03:00 - 06:00 | Setting Up Random Search in Scikit-Learn
- **Script:** "Let’s implement Random Search using Scikit-Learn’s RandomizedSearchCV. We’ll set up a similar parameter grid as before, but this time we’ll specify ranges for each hyperparameter, allowing Random Search to sample values from these ranges."
- **Code:**
  ```python
  from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
  from tensorflow.keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasClassifier
  import scipy.stats as stats

  # Define a function to create the model
  def create_model(learning_rate=0.001):
      model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
          tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 3)),
          tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
          tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
          tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
          tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
      ])
      model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate),
                    loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
      return model

  model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_model, epochs=5, batch_size=32, verbose=0)

  # Define parameter distribution
  param_dist = {'batch_size': [16, 32, 64], 'learning_rate': stats.uniform(0.0001, 0.01)}
  random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(estimator=model, param_distributions=param_dist, n_iter=10, cv=3, random_state=42)
  random_search_result = random_search.fit(train_data, validation_data=validation_data)
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Show the code and explain the use of statistical distributions for parameters like learning rate.
- **Effort:** Describe how the `n_iter` parameter controls the number of random combinations, balancing exploration and computational cost.

### 06:00 - 08:00 | Reviewing Random Search Results
- **Script:** "Once Random Search completes, we can inspect the best hyperparameters found. Random Search provides the best parameter combination and accuracy, helping us see if it discovered a more efficient model setup compared to grid search."
- **Code:**
  ```python
  print(f"Best Hyperparameters: {random_search_result.best_params_}")
  print(f"Best Accuracy: {random_search_result.best_score_ * 100:.2f}%")
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Display the best hyperparameters and accuracy found by Random Search, comparing them to previous grid search results.
- **Effort:** Discuss the results, highlighting any differences from grid search and the potential benefits of using Random Search in similar projects.

---

### 08:00 - 09:00 | Visualizing Random Search Results
- **Script:** "Let’s visualize how each randomly sampled combination performed. This will give us insights into which hyperparameters seem most impactful and help guide future tuning."
- **Code:**
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  # Extract results
  results = random_search_result.cv_results_['mean_test_score']
  param_combinations = [str(x) for x in random_search_result.cv_results_['params']]

  plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
  plt.plot(param_combinations, results, 'o-')
  plt.xticks(rotation=90)
  plt.xlabel("Hyperparameter Combinations")
  plt.ylabel("Accuracy")
  plt.title("Random Search Performance Across Hyperparameter Combinations")
  plt.show()
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Show the plot with accuracy results for each random combination tested.
- **Effort:** Emphasize the benefit of visualizing performance, as it provides a deeper understanding of which hyperparameters impact accuracy.

---

### 09:00 - 10:00 | Choosing Between Grid and Random Search
- **Script:** "Choosing between grid search and random search depends on the problem. If we have a small number of hyperparameters, grid search may be more thorough. But with more complex models and larger hyperparameter spaces, random search can save time and still yield good results. The key is understanding the trade-offs and picking the right tool for the job."
- **Screen Capture:** Display a comparison summary of grid vs. random search to solidify understanding.
- **Effort:** Reinforce the practical considerations that influence the choice of hyperparameter tuning strategy.

---

### Closing
- **Script:** "And that wraps up hyperparameter tuning with Random Search! We’ve seen how it can streamline the tuning process, especially when we have many hyperparameters. In the next episode, we’ll explore even more advanced techniques like Bayesian Optimization. Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and hit the bell to stay updated with DIYMachineLearning!"
- **Screen Capture:** Outro screen with the series name, episode number, and a teaser for the next episode on advanced optimization techniques.
- **Effort:** Encourage viewers to try Random Search on different datasets and explore the balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy.
