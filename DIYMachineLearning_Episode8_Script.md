## Episode 8: Preprocessing Images for Machine Learning

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! Today, we’re tackling an essential step in the machine learning pipeline: image preprocessing. This step prepares images for training by ensuring they’re all in a consistent format and have similar properties. We’ll cover resizing, normalization, and data augmentation so that our dataset is well-prepared for model training."
- **Screen Capture:** Intro screen with episode title and examples of unprocessed vs. processed images.
- **Effort:** Emphasize that preprocessing is key for training effective models, as it helps the model learn from consistent data.

---

### 00:30 - 03:30 | Resizing Images
- **Script:** "The first step in preprocessing is resizing. Most models expect input images to be of the same size. Let’s resize our images to 128x128 pixels using the Pillow library, a popular tool for image processing in Python."
- **Code:**
  ```python
  from PIL import Image
  import os

  def resize_images(folder_path, target_size=(128, 128)):
      for img_file in os.listdir(folder_path):
          img_path = os.path.join(folder_path, img_file)
          with Image.open(img_path) as img:
              img_resized = img.resize(target_size)
              img_resized.save(img_path)  # Overwrite the original file
      print("Images resized to 128x128 pixels")
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Show each line of code being typed and explain the function for resizing images. Display a before-and-after example of a resized image.
- **Effort:** Explain why resizing is important and demonstrate resizing with clear visuals.

### 03:30 - 06:30 | Normalizing Images
- **Script:** "After resizing, the next step is normalization. Normalization scales the pixel values, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1, making it easier for the model to process. Let’s use NumPy to normalize the pixel values of our images to the 0-1 range."
- **Code:**
  ```python
  import numpy as np

  def normalize_image(img_path):
      with Image.open(img_path) as img:
          img_array = np.asarray(img) / 255.0  # Scale pixels to 0-1
          return img_array
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Show the original pixel values compared to the normalized values, highlighting the change in value range.
- **Effort:** Emphasize the benefit of normalization, as it reduces variance in pixel values and improves model performance.

### 06:30 - 08:30 | Data Augmentation
- **Script:** "Data augmentation generates variations of our images, which helps increase the diversity of our dataset. This can include transformations like rotating, flipping, or zooming into images. Let’s use the Keras library to apply basic augmentation."
- **Code:**
  ```python
  from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

  def augment_images(folder_path):
      datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rotation_range=20, width_shift_range=0.1, height_shift_range=0.1, horizontal_flip=True)
      for img_file in os.listdir(folder_path):
          img_path = os.path.join(folder_path, img_file)
          img = np.expand_dims(np.array(Image.open(img_path)), axis=0)  # Expand dimensions to match datagen
          i = 0
          for batch in datagen.flow(img, batch_size=1, save_to_dir=folder_path, save_prefix='aug', save_format='jpeg'):
              i += 1
              if i > 5:  # Save 5 augmented images per original
                  break
      print("Data augmentation complete")
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Show examples of augmented images and explain each augmentation parameter.
- **Effort:** Emphasize the importance of data diversity, which helps models generalize better to unseen data.

---

### 08:30 - 10:00 | Reviewing the Preprocessed Dataset
- **Script:** "Once we’ve resized, normalized, and augmented our images, let’s take a moment to review the dataset. Checking the consistency of our preprocessed images ensures that our data is well-prepared for training. Take a look at a few random images to confirm the changes."
- **Screen Capture:** Show a side-by-side comparison of original vs. preprocessed images in the folder structure.
- **Effort:** Reinforce that reviewing the dataset at each step is critical to catching issues early on.

---

### Closing
- **Script:** "And that’s it for image preprocessing! We now have a dataset that’s resized, normalized, and augmented, ready for training our machine learning model. In the next episode, we’ll start building a simple image classifier using this preprocessed data. Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and hit the bell icon to keep up with DIYMachineLearning!"
- **Screen Capture:** Outro screen with the series name, episode number, and a teaser for the next episode on building a classifier.
- **Effort:** Encourage viewers to try different augmentation settings and reinforce the importance of preprocessing.
