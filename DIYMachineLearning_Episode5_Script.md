## Episode 5: Designing Basic ML Pipelines

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! Today, we’re going to design a basic ML pipeline. An ML pipeline is a step-by-step process that guides data from its raw form all the way to a trained machine learning model. Pipelines help us organize tasks like data preparation, model training, and evaluation, making our work efficient and repeatable."
- **Screen Capture:** Intro screen with episode title and a diagram showing the pipeline stages (Data Collection, Processing, Training, Evaluation).
- **Effort:** Introduce the importance of a structured pipeline for making machine learning projects easier to manage.

### 00:30 - 03:30 | Understanding ML Pipeline Stages
- **Script:** "Let’s look at the typical stages in an ML pipeline. We start with data collection, where we gather raw data from sources like files or databases. Next is data processing, where we clean and prepare the data for analysis. Then we have model training, where we teach the model using labeled data. Finally, we evaluate the model to see how well it performs on new, unseen data."
- **Screen Capture:** Show a simple diagram with arrows between stages: Data Collection → Processing → Training → Evaluation.
- **Effort:** Emphasize the purpose of each stage and why following these steps in order is important for building reliable models.

### 03:30 - 07:30 | Creating a Basic Pipeline Code Structure
- **Script:** "Now, let’s create a basic pipeline structure in Python. We’ll use simple functions for each stage so that we can easily see how data flows through each step. First, let’s define a function for data loading, where we’ll load a CSV file and prepare it for processing."
- **Code:**
  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  # Data loading function
  def load_data(file_path):
      data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
      print("Data loaded successfully")
      return data

  # Data processing function
  def process_data(data):
      # Simple cleaning operation
      data.fillna(0, inplace=True)
      return data

  # Model training function (placeholder)
  def train_model(data):
      print("Training model...")
      # Model training code would go here
      return "model"

  # Evaluation function (placeholder)
  def evaluate_model(model, test_data):
      print("Evaluating model...")
      # Model evaluation code would go here
      return "evaluation_results"
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Show typing each function in a Jupyter notebook or Python file to explain each function's purpose.
- **Effort:** Explain each function’s role, even if they’re placeholders, to help beginners understand how to organize code in a modular way.

### 07:30 - 09:30 | Executing the Pipeline
- **Script:** "With our pipeline functions defined, we can now execute each stage step-by-step to see the data flow. We’ll start by loading data, then process it, train the model, and finally evaluate it. Let’s walk through each step."
- **Code:**
  ```python
  # Load data
  data = load_data('data.csv')

  # Process data
  processed_data = process_data(data)

  # Train model
  model = train_model(processed_data)

  # Evaluate model
  results = evaluate_model(model, processed_data)
  print("Pipeline complete:", results)
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Run each part of the pipeline in a sequence, displaying outputs at each stage to show progress.
- **Effort:** Emphasize the modularity of the code, which allows for easy changes or updates in specific parts of the pipeline.

### Closing
- **Script:** "That’s it for our basic ML pipeline! Now you have a simple yet effective framework to guide data through each stage, from loading and processing to training and evaluating a model. In the next episode, we’ll start working with a supervised learning model. Be sure to like, subscribe, and hit the bell to follow along with DIYMachineLearning!"
- **Screen Capture:** Outro screen with the series name, episode number, and a teaser for the next episode on supervised learning.
- **Effort:** Encourage viewers to explore adding more functions or testing other datasets as a way to practice working with the pipeline.
