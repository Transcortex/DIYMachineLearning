## Episode 8: Preprocessing Images for Machine Learning

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! Today, we’ll prepare our images for machine learning. This process, called preprocessing, gets our images into a format that the model can understand. We’ll cover resizing, normalization, and augmentation."

---

### 00:30 - 03:30 | Resizing Images
- **Script:** "First, let’s resize all images to the same size, like 128x128 pixels. Consistent image sizes help the model learn more efficiently. Use the `Pillow` library in Python for resizing."

---

### 03:30 - 06:30 | Normalizing Images
- **Script:** "Next, normalize the images by scaling pixel values between 0 and 1. This helps the model process the images better. You can use NumPy to divide each pixel value by 255 to achieve this."

---

### 06:30 - 08:30 | Data Augmentation
- **Script:** "Data augmentation increases our dataset’s diversity by creating variations, like rotating or flipping images. This helps the model generalize better. Use the `ImageDataGenerator` in Keras for quick augmentation."

---

### 08:30 - 10:00 | Reviewing the Preprocessed Dataset
- **Script:** "Finally, let’s review the dataset to ensure consistency. Check a few images to make sure they’re resized, normalized, and correctly augmented. This step ensures that our dataset is ready for model training."

---

### Closing
- **Script:** "That’s it for image preprocessing! Now we have a dataset that’s ready for training. In the next episode, we’ll build a simple image classifier. Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and join us for more DIYMachineLearning!"
