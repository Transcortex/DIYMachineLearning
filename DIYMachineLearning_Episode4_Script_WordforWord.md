## Episode 4: Understanding ETL Basics for Machine Learning

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! Today, we’ll cover ETL, a key process for machine learning that stands for Extract, Transform, Load. ETL helps us prepare data so our models can learn effectively. We’ll break down each step so you’re ready to work with any dataset."

---

### 00:30 - 03:30 | Step 1: Extracting Data
- **Script:** "First, we extract data. This means pulling in data from files or databases. We’ll use a CSV file to keep it simple. In Python, we can load CSV data using the `pandas` library with `pd.read_csv('data.csv')`. This loads the data into a table format that’s easy to work with."

---

### 03:30 - 07:00 | Step 2: Transforming Data
- **Script:** "Next is transformation, where we clean and structure the data. This can include filling in missing values or converting data types. For example, we can use `data.fillna(0, inplace=True)` to fill any missing values with 0. This step ensures consistency across our dataset."

---

### 07:00 - 09:00 | Step 3: Loading Data
- **Script:** "The final step is loading, where we save the transformed data. This can mean saving it to a new CSV or database, making it ready for analysis or model training. Use `data.to_csv('cleaned_data.csv', index=False)` to save it as a new CSV."

### Closing
- **Script:** "And that’s it for ETL! Now you know how to extract, transform, and load data—an essential skill in machine learning. In the next episode, we’ll create a basic ML pipeline to combine these steps with model training. Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and hit the bell for more DIYMachineLearning!"
