## Episode 7: Building Your First Dataset for Image Classification

---

### 00:00 - 00:30 | Introduction
- **Script:** "Welcome back to DIYMachineLearning! Today, we’ll be creating our first dataset specifically for image classification. When we build machine learning models, the dataset quality is crucial for accurate predictions. By the end of this episode, you’ll know how to gather, label, and organize images to create a dataset for a supervised learning task."
- **Screen Capture:** Intro screen with episode title and a visual of a few images being labeled for classification.
- **Effort:** Emphasize the importance of dataset quality and structure in successful model building.

### 00:30 - 03:00 | Finding or Collecting Images
- **Script:** "To build an image classification model, we need a collection of labeled images. You can either download existing datasets or create your own by gathering images. Popular sources for free datasets include Kaggle, Google’s Open Images Dataset, and other open-access resources. For this demonstration, let’s say we’re creating a dataset to classify images as ‘cats’ or ‘dogs’."
- **Screen Capture:** Show examples of browsing through image datasets on Kaggle or other platforms.
- **Effort:** Clarify that pre-made datasets can save time, while collecting original images offers more customization but requires more effort.

### 03:00 - 06:00 | Organizing Images into Folders
- **Script:** "Once we have our images, it’s important to keep them organized. The simplest way to do this is by using folders. Create a main folder named ‘dataset’, and within it, create two subfolders: one named ‘cats’ and the other ‘dogs’. Place each image in the appropriate folder based on its category. This structure will make it easy for our model to understand the different categories during training."
- **Code:**
  ```bash
  mkdir -p dataset/cats
  mkdir -p dataset/dogs
  ```
- **Screen Capture:** Show creating folders for ‘cats’ and ‘dogs’ in a file explorer or terminal.
- **Effort:** Explain why folder organization is key in ML projects, as it allows models to easily distinguish between classes.

### 06:00 - 08:30 | Labeling Images with Tools (LabelImg)
- **Script:** "If you’re working with images that require labeling, you can use tools like LabelImg. LabelImg is a popular, free tool for image annotation, allowing you to draw bounding boxes and assign labels to each object in the image. Download LabelImg, open an image, and label each object based on its category."
- **Screen Capture:** Show LabelImg interface, opening an image, drawing a bounding box, and assigning a label.
- **Effort:** Demonstrate how to use the tool step-by-step, especially focusing on saving annotations in the correct format for ML projects.

### 08:30 - 10:00 | Saving and Verifying the Dataset
- **Script:** "After organizing and labeling, our dataset is ready. The next step is to verify that all images are correctly labeled and structured. Double-check your folder organization and ensure each label is correct. Mistakes in labeling or organization can lead to incorrect model predictions, so this step is crucial."
- **Screen Capture:** Show final folder structure and labeled images, with a brief check of the annotations to confirm correctness.
- **Effort:** Emphasize the importance of thorough verification to avoid errors in training due to mislabeled data.

### Closing
- **Script:** "And that’s it for building your first dataset! Now we have a well-organized collection of labeled images, ready for training a classification model. In the next episode, we’ll preprocess these images to make them suitable for training. Be sure to like, subscribe, and hit the bell icon to keep learning with DIYMachineLearning!"
- **Screen Capture:** Outro screen with the series name, episode number, and a teaser for the next episode on image preprocessing.
- **Effort:** Encourage viewers to experiment with organizing and labeling their own datasets, as practice strengthens understanding.
